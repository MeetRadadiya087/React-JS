
1. Introduction to React.js :

    * Purpose: JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs).
    * Focus: Ideal for single-page applications (SPAs).


    Features :

        * Component-Based Architecture: Reusable UI components.
        * Virtual DOM: Efficient updates and rendering.
        * Unidirectional Data Flow: Simplifies data management.


2. History of React.js :

    A. 2011: Developed by Jordan Walke at Facebook.
    B. 2012: Open-sourced at JSConf US.
    C. 2013: Introduced JSX (JavaScript XML).
    D. 2015: React 0.14 split into separate packages.
    E. 2016: React 15 improved rendering performance.
    F. 2017: React 16 featured core architecture rewrite.
    G. 2018: Introduced React Hooks for state management.
    H. 2020: React 17 focused on easier upgrades.
    I. 2021: React 18 added automatic batching and concurrent rendering.

3. What is React.js ?

    Ans. => React is a tool for building UI Components.
         => React, sometimes referred to as a frontend Javascript framework, is a Javascript library created by Facebook.


4. Advance Version of React.js :: ES6 (EchmaECMA Script 6) :

    * It is advance version of React.js .

    # Features of ES6 :




5. Full Forms in React.js : 

    A. npx  : Node Package Exicuter.
    B. npm  : Node Package Manager.
    C. swc  : Speedy Web Compiler.
    D. cd   : Change Directory [ Change Folder ].
    E. git  : Global Information Tracker.
    F. jsx  : Javascript Syntax Extention // or // Javascript XML.
    G. api  : Application Programming Interface.
    H. rfc  : React Functional Component.
    I. rfce : React Functional Component Export.
    J. rcc  : React Class Component
    

6. Array Objects and Method :

    * Array : Collections of Datatypes.

    * Destructuring : Devide objects to small Variables.

    * Spread : The Spread Operator is ( . . . ) is a Javascript feature that allows an iterable to be expanded into individual elements or properties.

    * Map : In React.js, map is a method to iterate over an array and render each element as a component.

    * Component : Component is a reuseble piese of code.

        Types of Component : A. Functional Component.
                             B. Class Component.

                            A. Functional Component : => A JavaScript function that returns JSX.



                            B. Class Component : => A class component in React.js is an ES6 class that extend React. Component, manager, state, and uses lifecycle methods to render JSX.

                                I  . props : Stands for properties.
                                II . state : Store the value with Update.

7. Life Cycle : 

      I. Component Did Mount.
     II. Component Did Update.
    III. Component Will Unmount.
